# Certificate Images

Place your certificate images in this folder. You can name them as:

- `certificate-1.jpg`
- `certificate-2.jpg`
- `certificate-3.jpg`
- `certificate-4.jpg`
- Or add more certificates by updating the HTML file

## Image Recommendations:
- Recommended size: 1200x800 pixels or similar aspect ratio
- Format: JPG or PNG
- File size: Keep under 1MB for faster loading
- Make sure certificates are clear and readable
- If an image is not found, a placeholder will be displayed automatically

## Adding More Certificates:

To add more certificates, update the `index.html` file in the certifications section by copying one of the existing certification cards and updating:
1. The image source path
2. The certificate title
3. The issuing organization
4. The date
5. The link to view the certificate
